# 👋 Hi, I'm Arthur Kretzer!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm passionate about building robust data pipelines, automating workflows, and contributing to open source projects.  
Whether it's orchestrating complex data flows, experimenting with new cloud technologies, or sharing my learnings, I love solving real-world problems with code.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Data Engineer at **CERTI Foundation** on the AI team.  
Currently pursuing a master's in Computer Science with a focus on Data Engineering for Industry 4.0.  
My journey began in Mechatronics Engineering, where I worked at **Alkimat**, one of the first companies in Latin America to build a selective laser melting machine for metal 3D printing.  
After that, I shifted my focus to Artificial Intelligence in my master’s program and migrated to Data Engineering, where I combine my passion for automation, analytics, and scalable systems.

I have been programming in Python for 9 years and love exploring the intersection of AI, data pipelines, and industrial automation.

I have built entire on-premises data lakes using open source technologies, orchestrating everything with Docker and Kubernetes.
